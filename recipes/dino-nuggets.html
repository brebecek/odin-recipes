        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These Dino Nuggets remind me of childhood. I only make this page because some people I know struggle to follow the back-of-the-bag instructions, and thats' okay.
                Perhaps, it's nice to know that someone we love has our back. I have your back.</p>
                <p>These pair perfectly with Kraft Mac n Cheese or your favorite creamy, saucy noodle by the way.</p>

                <li>Your favorite bag of Dino Nuggets</li>
