        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This dish will wow you or your guest with little effort. The sauce will come together on its' own, and if you mess up the water to ingredient ratio, you can fix it right up!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>9 oz or so of pumpkin ravioli</li>
                <li>4 tbsp of butter</li>
                <li>25 g of pecans</li>
                <li>6 fresh sage leaves</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set a pot of water to boil.</li>
                <li>Finely chop 25 g of pecans, and toast them in a dry pan over medium heat. Remove before they get smokey.</li>
                <li>Add in ravioli and cook per package instructions.</li>
                <li>Add to same pan 4 tbsp of butter and 6 fresh sage leaves.</li>
                <li>Cook this butter down until it turns brown. It should never turn black. Err on the side of caution. When done, remove the sage leaves and put them to the side.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce is browned, and the ravioli is finished cooking, add raviolo to the sauce pan. A little pasta water should be added, but not more than a quarter cup.</li>
                <li>Stir this until it comes together. If it is too dry, add more water. If it is too loose and wet, continue to cook on medium heat and let some of the sauce cook off.</li>
                <li>Transfer to plate, and add your crispy sage leaves and toasted pecans on top to garnish. Season with salt, pepper, and parmesan to taste.</li>
            </ol>
